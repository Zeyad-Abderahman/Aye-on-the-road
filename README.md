# Sleep Detector - Driver Drowsiness Detection System  

The **Sleep Detector** is a groundbreaking, AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize road safety by preventing fatigue-related accidents. Drowsy driving is a global epidemic, contributing to thousands of accidents annually, many of which result in severe injuries or fatalities. Traditional methods of detecting drowsiness, such as self-assessment or external monitoring, are often unreliable and prone to human error. To combat this critical issue, the Sleep Detector leverages state-of-the-art **deep learning** and **computer vision** technologies to provide an automated, real-time drowsiness detection system that ensures driver safety and reduces the risk of accidents.  

This project is not just a technological innovation; itâ€™s a life-saving tool. By continuously monitoring a driverâ€™s alertness through advanced AI algorithms, the Sleep Detector can identify early signs of fatigue and trigger timely alerts, potentially saving countless lives. Whether youâ€™re a long-haul truck driver, a commuter, or a fleet manager, this system is designed to keep you and others safe on the road.

## Key Features  

### 1. **Real-Time Drowsiness Detection**  
   - The system continuously monitors the driverâ€™s alertness in real time using a webcam or integrated camera.  
   - It analyzes facial features such as eye openness, blink rate, and head position to detect signs of drowsiness.  

### 2. **Advanced AI and Deep Learning**  
   - Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, the deep learning model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of drowsy and alert facial images.  
   - The model achieves high accuracy in classifying driver states as "Drowsy" or "Alert."  

### 3. **Computer Vision for Facial Landmark Detection**  
   - Utilizes **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for real-time image processing and facial landmark detection.  
   - Tracks critical indicators of drowsiness, such as eye closure duration, yawning, and head tilt.  

### 4. **Immediate Alert System**  
   - When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alert, which can include:  
     - **Sound alarms** (e.g., beeps or voice alerts).  
     - **Visual warnings** (e.g., flashing lights or on-screen notifications).  
     - **Integrated responses** in smart vehicle systems (e.g., automatic braking or lane correction).  

### 5. **Lightweight and Optimized for Real-Time Performance**  
   - Designed to operate efficiently with minimal delay, ensuring timely detection and response.  
   - Suitable for deployment on various platforms, including laptops, mobile devices, and embedded systems.  

### 6. **User-Friendly Graphical Interface (GUI)**  
   - Features an intuitive **GUI** built with **Tkinter** or **PyQt**, allowing users to easily start, stop, and configure the system.  
   - Provides real-time feedback and visualizations of driver alertness.  

### 7. **Scalable and Future-Ready Architecture**  
   - Supports integration with IoT devices for in-car alerts and notifications.  
   - Can be deployed on **mobile platforms** using **TensorFlow Lite** or embedded hardware like **Raspberry Pi**.  
   - Compatible with automotive systems for seamless operation in modern vehicles.

## How It Works  

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - The system is trained on a labeled dataset containing thousands of images of drowsy and alert individuals.  
   - The dataset is preprocessed using **Pandas** and **scikit-learn** to handle imbalances and improve model accuracy.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - A deep learning model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify driver states as "Drowsy" or "Alert."  
   - The model is fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance in real-world scenarios.  

3. **Real-Time Detection**  
   - **OpenCV** captures video feed from a webcam or integrated camera.  
   - **MediaPipe** detects facial landmarks, such as eye openness and head position, in real time.  

4. **Alert Triggering**  
   - If the system detects signs of drowsiness (e.g., prolonged eye closure or excessive yawning), it immediately triggers an alert to wake the driver.
