Sleep Detector is an AI-powered system that detects driver drowsiness in real time using deep learning and computer vision. It analyzes facial features from a webcam to classify drivers as drowsy or alert, helping prevent fatigue-related accidents. Built with Keras and TensorFlow, the model is trained on a labeled dataset for accurate detection.
